# Eye-Tracking-Old
An old algorithm I made for a Computer Vision course as the final. The purpose is to identify and track eye movement across frames of animation / video. Most methods I found at the time used a Viola method or had the user select the eyes ahead of time. I did not think that would be apt, so I made this method and it finds all possible eyes and tracks them. If a pair of "eyes" disappear, it gets culled from the search algorithm. There is an rtf file that I turned in with this project that should explain what I did, and my references. This is a cleaned up version. Don't have any sample output to show, but it did have a false positive if I remember using the given image set I used.
